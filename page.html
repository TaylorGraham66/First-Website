            <h2 class=center>Tiger Dorm Defender Website</h2>
            <p class="centerBody">My team and I were tasked with creating a program that would allow students who lost their Tiger Card to be able to unlock their dorm rooms remotely. We designed a website that allowed for the students to input their dorm, LSU ID, password, and a security question to be able to "unlock" their dorm room. The project was completed with React and Tailwind as well as used Mongoose for the database to store information. The website is also mobile friendly.</p>
