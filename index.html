        <div class="h3">Tiger Dorm Defender Website</div>
        My team and I were tasked with creating a program that would allow students who lost their Tiger Card<br>to be able to unlock their dorm rooms remotely. We designed a website that allowed for the students to input their dorm,<br> LSU ID, password, and a security question to be able to "unlock" their dorm room. The project was completed with React<br> and Tailwind as well as used Mongoose for the database to store information. The website is also mobile friendly.
